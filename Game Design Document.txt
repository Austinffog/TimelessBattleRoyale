Future Gameplay Ideas

* Include different maps to switch between. These maps will have different themes and the monsters will change according to the map and theme.

* Pause button.

Sound
* Background music.
* Sound for button clicks.
* And a sound for firing the weapon of the character.
* Monsters won't make a sound.

Challenges that were overcome
* Getting the coroutines to start only once in update method
-Challenge was overcome by starting the coroutine in start and setting a while loop condition to prevent instantiating gameObjects before the condition is met
-Starting the coroutine in update kept starting it on every new update frame.
* Registering the right gameObject collisions amongst each other
-The enemies colliding with each other would register and increase the killcount and time, this was overcome by checking not only if something has collided with the 
enemy gameObject but specifying if it was the player bullet.
* Small challenge: enemy follow player movement
-The target transform of the player was placed in start this would make the enemy follow from the players old position when the enemy spawned and not update,
problem solved by placing the player transform into the update method so that it is regularly updating the players position.
-Also, a vector2 was used but this set the enemy z axis to 0, so a vector3 was used to set the enemy on the same z axis as the player, to be seen.
